Analytics Engineering Case Study

Salla is an e-commerce platform that allows merchants to create an online store or move their business online. 
You are working in Salla as an Analytics Engineer and your manager assigned a task for you that will contribute to another project that the product team is working on. This will help them in the process of identifying trends and patterns and guide the project’s strategy.
You will be given 4 datasets which you will load to any database software of your choice and combine the tables together to work on the tasks that will be assigned to you.

Tables brief and column description will be shared in a separate Excel sheet.

Use the datasets given to you to help in providing insights to the product-team in the following, and note that the 4 tasks should be completed using SQL:
1. What are the top selling products in general, and by region.
2. What are the most popular categories?
3. Calculate monthly, quarterly and yearly sales. (All products combined).
4. What is the average sale by product category and what are the top product category based on customer location?

Complete the following 3 tasks in python:
1. Calculate the top 10 stores with the highest average daily sales. 
2. Calculate the percentage of monthly growth in sales for each store.   
3. Conduct cohort analysis on customers’ orders. Analyze the cohorts based on the month in which the customer made their first purchase and analyze their behavior over time. The results should be displayed as a heatmap that tracks the analysis by each month for every cohort. 

Please note that you need to visualize your findings from all the tasks above. It is up to you to decide on how to visualize your results.
